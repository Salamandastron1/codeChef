You are given a rectangular grid with NN rows and MM columns. A number Ai,jAi,j​ is written in the cell belonging to the ithith row and the jthjth column.

    Ai,j=1Ai,j​=1, for all 1≤i≤N1≤i≤N and 1≤j≤M1≤j≤M, except for i=Ni=N and j=Mj=M.
    AN,M=0AN,M​=0.

Find the number of sub-rectangular grids which contain only 11s.
